# Cyclone Physics; 2019 refactor

This is a final project for msim495, which is taught using the Cyclone physics engine.

The code under `cyclone-src` and parts of `cyclone-headers` originates from [https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics](https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics).

# Improvements

 * Improved API to build programs on top of the library

# Collision sources

`cyclone-src/collision.cpp` and `cyclone-headers/cyclone/collision.h`.

# Good one-liners

`make && ( cd example-application ; make && ./build/app )`
